# 🧠✨ Sleep Disorder Detection & Data Visualization Project

Welcome to my **final project** on sleep disorder analysis! This R-based project combines **data cleaning**, **clustering**, and **classification** with powerful **visualizations** to uncover hidden patterns behind sleep-related health issues. 🌙💤

---

## 📁 Project Overview

🔬 **Objective**: Predict and understand sleep disorders using real-world health and lifestyle data.
💡 **Approach**: Visual exploratory analysis, K-means clustering, and decision tree modeling in R.

## 📊 Key Techniques

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

* Removed missing and infinite values
* Converted categorical variables to numeric using factor encoding

### 🔍 Clustering

* Performed **K-means clustering**
* Visualized clusters using `clusplot()` and `fviz_cluster()`

### 🌳 Classification

* Built a **Decision Tree** using `rpart`
* Visualized the tree with `rpart.plot()`

### 🧪 Model Evaluation

* Evaluated predictions using **Confusion Matrix** from the `caret` package
* Measured accuracy and classification performance
